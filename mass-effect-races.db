Their unique physiology is dependant on sunlight and allows them to produce natural bioelectrical fields. The angara as a people are very free with their emotions, demonstrative and \"larger than life\". If they love you they hug you, if they hate you or if you make them mad, they punch you.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Creatures of the Sun</h2>\n<p>The angara need electromagnetic radiation that is emitted from stars to survive. Lack of real or artificial sunlight causes them to \"go dark\", which weakens their immune systems and bio-energy significantly. Prolonged lack of sunlight can lead to a coma and then death. To supplement their sunlight intake or provide a light source when natural light is not readily available, the angara make use of powerful ultraviolet lamps that give them both heat and light.</p>\n<h2>Family Oriented</h2>\n<p>While they have only one true mother and father, the angara share their parents with the community. Their families are very large, consisting of multiple mothers and many siblings and cousins. This close-knit society makes angara very mistrustful of other races.</p>\n<p>While the angara have many different religions, all share the same basic tenet: that when an angara dies, he or she is reincarnated and the reincarnated soul stays in the family, making their lineage stronger.</p>\n<h2>Angara Names</h2>\n<p>Little is known about angaran names.

{"name":"Asari","permission":{"default":0,"jNK2CIwjGgz7m8OS":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Asari are a race of elegant, mono-gendered humanoids. The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a crest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or gender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction initiated by a \"mind meld\" which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different race-to randomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to manipulate mass effect fields.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unmatched Patience</h2>\n<p>Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a \"long view\" not common in other races. When they encounter a new species or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action. They invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will inevitably influence the existing culture.</p>\n<h2>Mothers of the Galaxy</h2>\n<p>Asari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the asari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of DNA. The offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead, the asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and as a \"map\" to randomize the genes of the offspring.</p>\n<p>Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the \"father\" from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown upon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so it's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as \"purebloods\", a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes asari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.</p>\n<h2>Maiden, Matron, Matriarch</h2>\n<p>Asari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. The&nbsp;Maiden&nbsp;stage begins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and it is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. The&nbsp;Matron&nbsp;stage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This period is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. The&nbsp;Matriarch&nbsp;stage begins around 700 years of age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors, dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space. However, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity.</p>\n<h2>Asari Names</h2>\n<p>Asari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari parents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with their personal name only. Matriarchs are addressed as \"Matriarch\" but other titles may be used for matriarchs in prestigious positions.</p>\n<p><strong>Personal Names</strong>: <em>Aeian, Aethyta, Aleena, Alestia, Aria, Batha, Benezia, Dahlia, Falere, Irissa, Jona, Liara, Lidanya, Liselle, Mallene, Morinth, Nassana, Nyxeris, Pelessaria, Rana, Rila, Samara, Sarissa, Shiala, Tela, Tevos, Treeya</em></p>\n<p><strong>Surnames</strong>: <em>Ateyne, B'Sayle, Calis, D'Layne, D'Nava, D'Ysesan, Dantius, Iallis, Iasava, Janieri, Kelis, M'Loari, M'Taros, Makenus, Nuwani, Sedela, Sederis, T'Goni, T'Loak, T'Soni, Thanoptis, Theris, V'Lanis, V'Nato, V'Tizor, Vasir</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Asari Traits</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Available Classes.&nbsp;</strong>Adept, Engineer, Infiltrator, Sentinel, Soldier, Vanguard</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;+2 Charisma, +1 Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Age.&nbsp;</strong>Asari are very long-lived and can reach ages of over 1000 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment.&nbsp;</strong>Asari are biased towards goodness, but exhibit a range of alignments not dissimilar to humans.

Your size is medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed.&nbsp;</strong>Your base walking speed is 10m.</p>\n<p><strong>Innate Biotics.&nbsp;</strong>Asari do not require biotic implants to control their abilities. Instead, their biotic talents rely on their ability to project their will onto the world. As an Asari, you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a biotic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p>Choose a class: Adept or Vanguard. You learn two biotic cantrips of your choice from that class&rsquo;s spell list. In addition, choose one 1st-level spell from that same list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.</p>\n<p>Neither of the cantrips nor the spell can be an advanced version. But you can learn or prepare an advanced version of the spell as your class permits.</p>\n<p><strong>Mind Meld.&nbsp;</strong>You can transfer and receive thoughts to another creature.

The condition is impossible to identify until the asari reaches maturity, by which time it is too late to correct. When diagnosed, the ardat-yakshi is given a choice to live in isolation or to be executed. This is because ardat-yakshi develop an addiction to the power and feel intense compulsion to meld. The addition only grows stronger with each meld, and so a life of monastic celibacy allows asari to leave in peace with a controllable desire. Those who are able to avoid isolation and execution, however, quickly become psychopathic in their intense lust for the destructive melding.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Variant Traits</h2>\n<p>If you would like to play an ardat-yakshi, you can choose to replace the&nbsp;Alignment&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mind Meld&nbsp;traits with the following.

The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be rendered unconscious for 1d4 hours as your nervous system overwhelms theirs. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Dominate.&nbsp;</strong>At 10th level, you learn the Dominate spell.

However, their migration is limited to a single planet as most elcor find the confines of space travel very uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Living Tanks</h2>\n<p>Because of their slow, conservative psyches, elcor are not suitable for making the spur-of-the-moment decisions necessary in combat situations. Instead, they rely on sophisticated VI combat systems. While easy targets, their durable hide allows them to shrug off most incoming fire. Elcor warriors use their broad shoulders as a mount for weaponry and their VI as a targeting mechanism. Some elcor are equipped with mass-accelerator cannons, the same weapons typically mounted on military vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Elcor Names</h2>\n<p>Elcor do not have gender-binary names because their gender is discerned through smell. While the names appear singular, they are made up of a much more complex set of sounds that only other elcor can hear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Elcor Names</strong>: <em>Calyn, Cyllyn, Detinos, Delzino, Felitos, Fazuti, Halzan, Harrot, Pedezlan, Petelenti, Petozi, Vatozi, Voletzi, Xeltan, Zatzoni</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Elcor Traits</h2>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Available Classes.&nbsp;</strong>Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Ability Score Increase. </strong>+2 Strength, +1 Wisdom</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Age. </strong>The average elcor lives to be around 300 years old. 100-year-old elcor are considered young.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Alignment. </strong>Elcor are methodical, deliberate creatures that never act on irrational decisions.

In 2069 CE, Armstrong Outpost in Shackleton Crater on Luna was founded as humanity's first extraterrestrial settlement. In 2103, the European Space Agency established Lowell City in Eos Chasma on Mars, paving the way for additional settlements and scientific outposts throughout Sol. In 2148, human explorers on Mars uncovered a long-ruined Prothean observation post, with a surviving data cache that proved Protheans had studied Cro-Magnon humans millennia ago. Discovering information on a mass relay orbiting Pluto, explorers managed to open the Charon Relay and discovered it led to Arcturus.</p>\n<h2>First Contact</h2>\n<p>Humans first came to the attention of the galactic community after a brief but intense conflict with the turians, known by humans as the First Contact War. As a consequence of the System Alliance's swift and decisive action during the First Contact War, the Alliance became the representative and supranational governing body of humanity. Since then, humans have rapidly risen in prominence. Humanity continued to expand to unclaimed star systems on the edge of Citadel space, which eventually led to competition with the batarians.</p>\n<h2>Systems Alliance</h2>\n<p>The Systems Alliance holds sway over much of the human race, but not all fall under its banner. A few colonies on the fringes of known space are founded on principles of independence, and Earth still has nation-states that administer to their own territories. To the galaxy at large, though, nonhumans are always under the perception that Earth is a unified political entity represented by the Alliance.</p>\n<h2>Galactic Relations</h2>\n<p>The Systems Alliance has had an embassy on the Citadel since 2165. Many other species dislike humans' sudden ascendancy compared to their status as relative newcomers on the galactic stage. Some species feel that humanity is overly expansive in its colonization efforts and aggressive attempts to advance its position in galactic affairs.

The krogan managed to not only survive on their unforgiving homeworld but actually thrived in the extreme conditions. Unfortunately, as krogan society became more technologically advanced, so did their weaponry. The end result is that they destroyed their homeworld in a nuclear war that reduced their race into primitive warring tribes.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Biologically Impervious</h2>\n<p>Krogan biology reflects the conditions from where they come. The krogan are armored nearly head to toe in thick, chitinous plates which protect the krogan from the hazards of their homeland. They possess a hump which can store water and nutrients, for the resources in Tuchanka are scare.</p>\n<p>Curiously, the krogan also possess redundant organs; a second set of major organs in case of failure or injury. These traits make krogan exceptionally difficult to kill, but perhaps what makes krogan so dangerous is an adaptation known as \"Blood Rage.\"</p>\n<h2>Blood Rage</h2>\n<p>The blood rage is a legendary state of pure violence. When krogan enter a blood rage, they become nearly mindless killing machines, fighting through all injury and even death. Blood rage is due to an enormous flood of adrenaline and suppression of serotonin, which numbs the krogan to all pain. This state, combined with their plated hide, and redundant organs, allows the krogan to defeat creatures many times his size or power.</p>\n<h2>Climb Atop the Dead</h2>\n<p>Krogan's value one thing above all else: strength. Krogan society is built upon this hierarchy, where the strong rule and the weak perish. They live in clans lead by a Warlord, and those clans constantly war for resources and for power. Even within these clans, treachery and distrust run rampant. Krogan often fight for dominance within these clans and will sacrifice their clan for personal gain without a second thought. Females are considered prizes and trophies and live in clans separate from the males.</p>\n<h2>Rites and Rituals</h2>\n<p>The krogan culture is steeped in rituals. When a krogan is born, he suffers the Rite of Life. When wishes to join his first clan, he undergoes the Rite of Passage. If he wishes to be considered for breeding, he must take the Rite of Honor. When facing a new enemy, the Rite of Firsts is invoked.</p>\n<p>A Krogan clan also has a shaman, who has endured the Rite of Insight. The rituals endured by a shaman are lengthy and torturous; most krogan who attempt the rite perish. Those who survive become the most respected member of their clan and are rarely challenged.

All quarians wear enviro-suits, which are multipurpose outfits that protect them from foreign pathogens and diseases as well as acting as spacesuits for scavenging or repair of shuttles. Rannoch's ecosystem featured symbiotic microorganisms that aren't found anywhere else in the galaxy. Thus, when the quarians were exiled, they were also burdened to life in a suit.</p>\n<p>The enviro-suits have moved beyond function, however, and into their culture. A quarian is rarely, if ever, seen without their suit and helmet, and when they return from their pilgrimage as adults, they are expected to modify their suit to fit their personal reflection of their status as a productive member of the Flotilla.</p>\n<h2>Exiles of their Own Creations</h2>\n<p>Quarians have a long and deep history with creating constructs known as \"Geth,\" meaning \"Servant of the People\". These constructs were built to serve and protect the quarians, and most quarian families had at least one servant, while the quarian military consisted of these autonomous beings.</p>\n<p>The quarians sought to constantly improve their creation with more advanced virtual intelligence so they could complete increasingly complex tasks. These improvements lead to the geth's sapience and they began to question their masters. The quarians attempted to exterminate them, but after forming so much dependence on the geth, the quarians were swiftly defeated. With many exterminated, the remaining quarians fled their homeland of Rannoch.</p>\n<h2>Cybernetic Improvements</h2>\n<p>Though the quarians have abandoned their long history of construct and VI creation, they put their knowledge of engineering and technology into their own bodies to augment themselves. These augments are crafted by artisans who have descended from or studied under those who originally worked with or programmed the geth. The implants themselves are normally small, no larger than the size of a palm, and when properly inserted give the quarian enhanced ability compared to those without. A quarian chooses an augment before they leave for the Pilgrimage, and the implantation of the device is part of their sending off ceremony.</p>\n<h2>Migrant Fleet</h2>\n<p>The nomads travel together in a collective of ships known as the Flotilla or the Migrant Fleet and consists of those who escaped death by the geth. The Flotilla contains over fifty thousand vessels collectively that travel the galaxy strip-mining and harvesting resource to keep the fleet afloat. Some ships decide to depart the fleet to pursue their own goals but normally return to the fleet.</p>\n<p>When young quarian rejoin the flotilla after their pilgrimage, they are expected to join the crew of another vessel to ensure genetic diversity of an already small population.</p>\n<h2>The Pilgrimage</h2>\n<p>During quarian adolescence, they are subjected to a rite of passage known as the pilgrimage. When young adulthood is reached, quarians are expected to leave the Migrant Fleet and experience life outside of their culture. To rejoin the flotilla, the young quarian must bear a gift to the captain of a new vessel. This gift can be tangible, such as resources, or intangible such as information. Most quarian operatives are those on their pilgrimage, though there are those who decide never to return to the fleet or those who were rejected from rejoining.</p>\n<h2>Quarian Names</h2>\n<p>Quarian names are composed of three parts: the quarian's given name and family name separated by an apostrophe, and the name of their vessel preceeded by a title - \"nar\" to denote their birth ship and \"vas\" to denote their post-pilgrimage ship.

Because the constructs were acting out of self-defense, when the enemy began retreating from their homeland of Rannoch, the geth did not pursue and allowed their masters to leave in peace.</p>\n<h2>Incomprehensible Mind</h2>\n<p>Geth minds are quite anomalous. As they were designed to follow predetermined steps and commands, and with their minds powered from a centralized network, their way of thinking is essentially unique and different than the chaotic organic minds of humanoids. Their thoughts can be compared to a program or process which systematically follows steps to come to a conclusion, run many times in different ways until the geth comes to a consensus of the correct course of action. Geth do not experience emotion or desire - not in the same way a humanoid does, anyway. Additionally, due to their innate ability to network with other geth, geth see themselves as a unit of a larger and more complex whole and even the individual processes that make up a single geth as being equal constituents that contribute to that geth unit.</p>\n<h2>Beyond the Veil</h2>\n<p>Geth primarily remain in the Perseus Veil: huge nebula of opaque gas and dust that separates geth space from the Terminus Systems. They live in peace, but some geth find themselves seeking knowledge of what is beyond their realm. The primary motivation of the geth who leave Rannoch is to acquire and compile information, though some geth pursue other quests.</p>\n<h2>Geth Names</h2>\n<p>Geth have no use for names among themselves but will adopt names for the sake of interacting with other races. However, the geth do not often see themselves as individuals. Many geth use plural pronouns such as \"us\" and \"we\". As a result, the names geth take are normally synonyms or words for groups. Geth with individuality, especially those who have been separated from their kind for an extended time, do exist. Those geth still use words for names, though they give themselves a more personally fitting name.</p>\n<p><strong>Geth Names</strong>: <em>Armada, Army, Batallion, Brigade, Cabal, Caucus, Congregate, Coterie, Guild, Horde, Host, Legion, Myriad, Phalanx, Proletariat, Throng, Troop, Union</em></p>\n<p><strong>'Individual' Geth Names:</strong> <em>Alpha, Apex, Beta, Centurion, Enigma, Eternity, Genesis, Obelisk, Oblivion, Omega, Oracle, Pinnacle, Terminus, Vortex, Zenith</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Geth Traits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Available Classes.</strong> Engineer, Infiltrator, Soldier</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Ability Score Increase. </strong>+2 Intelligence, +1 Strength</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Age. </strong>Geth do not age, as they are constructs, and live as long as their bodies are not destroyed.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Alignment. </strong>Your standard Geth platform is neutral good, wanting to prosper and communicate with others, defending themselves only if threatened.

{"name":"Turian","permission":{"default":0,"jNK2CIwjGgz7m8OS":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>A highly militaristic race, turians are a force to be feared. These warriors are easily distinguished by an appearance containing a strange mix of insectoid and avian features. The turian army is substantial, and every member of the turian race is obligated to attend combat training in adolescence. Even citizens and artisans are foes to be reckoned with. Despite such an emphasis on combat, however, turians are an honorable and noble race.</em></p>\n<h2>Discipline and Honor</h2>\n<p>The entire turian culture revolves around a strict code of conduct which highly emphasizes strong discipline and personal responsibility. Turians are highly inclined towards self-sacrifice and will put the good of society over their own personal desires. As such, they are passionate about public and social service and make poor merchants and entrepreneurs. They are taught to own their decisions, good or bad, and if confronted with accusations it is considered heinous to lie about their actions. Because of this, many races attribute to them a \"turian honor\" seen rarely outside the turian race.</p>\n<h2>Proud Warrior Race</h2>\n<p>At the center of turian society is their military. Turians are sent to basic training in their teenage years and are obligated to serve time in the military, if physically able. This develops respect for authority as well as imparting control and restraint among the turians. Though some turians do not continue their service in the armed forces, they continue to serve their community through other branches of the military which serve the whole by providing public services.</p>\n<h2>Hierarchal Meritocracy</h2>\n<p>Turian government is entwined with its military, as so many parts of society are. There are tiers of citizenship, with the lowest being a regular citizen, often held by client races and children, climbing all the way up to the Primarchs which lead each turian colony. Lower ranking citizens are expected to obey and support superiors while higher ranking ones are expected to lead and protect lower ranks. Promotion to a new tier is based on personal ability and merit and are given due to assessments from one's superiors.</p>\n<p>Despite the ranked structure, turians entertain many freedoms as long as they perform their duties and do not infringe on others freedoms or responsibilities.</p>\n<h2>Reflective Carapace</h2>\n<p>The homeland of the turians, Palaven, has a high level of solar radiation. Turians have evolved semi-metallic carapaces that reflect the dangerous radiation, protecting their inners from the solar rays. These exoskeletons, however, do not protect the turian from physical damage such as wounds and do not provide any natural armor.</p>\n<h2>Mission or Desertion</h2>\n<p>Most Turians who leave Palaven or another colony do so by order of their superiors to accomplish special missions. Some, however, abandon the society for various reasons, most commonly a desire for freedom from the unyielding law and command. Those who desert their military post or other assigned position are exiled from Palaven, as this is seen as the ultimate betrayal.</p>\n<h2>Turian Names</h2>\n<p>Turians are given personal names by their parents and take on a family name. High-ranking turian officers also include their title in their names, either in addition to their full names or as a replacement of their personal name.

They hail from Irune, which possesses a high-pressure greenhouse atmosphere able to support ammonia-based biochemistry.</em></p>\n<h2>Mysterious Biology</h2>\n<p>The volus are unable to survive unprotected in an atmosphere more suitable to humans and other carbon-based lifeforms, and as such require pressurized, protective suits capable of providing the proper atmosphere. Traditional nitrogen/oxygen air mixtures are poisonous to them, and in the low pressure atmospheres tolerable to most species, their flesh will actually split open.Unlike quarians, who can withstand brief periods outside their suit, volus choose never to take theirs off, especially in the presence of other races. Therefore, little is known about their physiology. Despite individuals distinctly sounding like males or females to human listeners, volus genders are a mystery as well. The volus themselves consider the question both intrusive and hilariously irrelevant.</p>\n<h2>Trade Warriors</h2>\n<p>The volus homeworld Irune is remarkable for having done away with warfare as an institution of the state. Instead, volus romanticize a good bargain, haggling, and creative accounting. The fervent pursuit of economic wealth has made volus a race of aggressive traders and industrialists with a keen grasp of exchange and finance. Many of the galaxy's largest banks, holding corporations, and manufacturing cartels, such as the Elkoss Combine, are owned or managed by volus. They also regulate the Citadel's complex galactic economy and were responsible for the Unified Banking Act, which established the \"credit\" as the standard currency of interstellar trade.</p>\n<p>Unlike most other races, volus are more comfortable with delayed gratification, especially when it comes to spending their credits. Fugacious and materialistic purchases are rarely made. Instead, volus like to invest or save their money, sometimes to a fault. In fact, the volus economy is largely bolstered by the large estates of wealthy volus who never spent a cred.</p>\n<h2>Council Seat</h2>\n<p>Despite their important contributions to the Citadel and galactic society, they have never been offered a seat on the Council. This is a source of anger for some volus, particularly the volus ambassador Din Korlack. Council races need to have provided some extraordinary service to the Citadel, such as the turians' military support during the Krogan Rebellions. Council races also need to provide fleets, resources, and economic aid in case of disaster, none of which the volus can currently supply. Therefore, the latest investment pursued by the volus is the construction of well-armed dreadnoughts.</p>\n<h2>Volus Names</h2>\n<p>Volus have two names but no family names.

The lack of resources has resulted in a tight-knit, clan-based society in which rival clans wage constant war against one another for control of scarce resources. Even as their population grows, the vorcha constantly fight each other in fierce competition over basic necessities. This incessant warfare has made each generation of vorcha stronger and more aggressive than that which preceded it, but their continual lack of resources has kept vorcha society extremely primitive.</em></p>\n<h2>Non-differentiated cells</h2>\n<p>The vorcha are known for a rather unique biology: they have clusters of non-differentiated cells, similar to those found on the planarian worm of Earth. These cells allow the vorcha limited regenerative abilities, as well as the ability to adapt quickly to its environment, such as developing thicker skin after being burned or increased musculature to survive in high gravity. When a vorcha is injured or in distress, these cells move to the affected area and rapidly (~1 week) mature to specialized forms that will alleviate the issue.</p>\n<h2>Clan Violence</h2>\n<p>Vorcha society is built around combat. In fact, the vorcha use combat, both individually and in groups, as their default form of communication. The vorcha are a clan-based people who prefer living in communal environments with others of their species to living alone or in the company of alien races. When a clan population grows too large, younger members will depart to start a new clan elsewhere.

{"name":"Hanar","permission":{"default":0,"jNK2CIwjGgz7m8OS":3},"type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>The hanar are a genderless species resembling Earth's jellyfish and are one of the few non-bipedal Citadel races. The hanar homeworld, Kahje, has 90% ocean cover and orbits an energetic white star, resulting in a permanent blanket of clouds. Hanar are known for their strong religious beliefs regarding the Protheans, whom they call \"the Enkindlers\". Hanar are extremely polite, almost to a fault. They never refer to themselves in the first person with someone they know on a face name basis: to do so is considered egotistical. Instead, they refer to themselves as \"this one,\" or the impersonal \"it.\" Even when flustered or angry, a hanar will still maintain exquisite poise and will remain formal even with those it wishes dead.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Enkindlers</h2>\n<p>Due to the presence of Prothean ruins on Kahje, the hanar have developed a religion centered on the ancient species, calling them the \"Enkindlers\". The hanar practice a religious holiday called Nyahir or \"First Cresting Bloom\" which lasts a full thirteen days and revolves around celebrating the gift of speech, which they attribute to having come from the Enkindlers. It is a mixture of contemplation and competition, with the faithful engaged in stylized debates, poetry duels, and other traditional hanar art forms. The winners of these events have their names inscribed in bio-luminescence on the side of Mount Vassla, an underwater volcano at the heart of one of the oldest Prothean ruins on Kahje.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Compact</h2>\n<p>Several hundred years ago, the hanar made contact with the drell on their nearby homeworld of Rakhana. Drell society was quickly collapsing due to overpopulation and warring over scarce resources, so the hanar rescued several hundred thousand drell and brought them to Kahje, where they integrated into hanar society with the remaining drell dying out. Now the drell serve as a client race of the hanar, and although to outside observers the relationship can be construed as a form of slavery, the reality is very different. Drell have integrated with every level of hanar society, and most consider it an honor to serve a hanar family in a tradition referred to as the Compact. Many drell become unofficial members of the family, and some even earn the privilege to learn their masters' \"soul names\".</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Language of Lights</h2>\n<p>The hanar communicate using sophisticated patterns of bioluminescence and speak with scrupulous precision and extreme politeness. Other species need machine assistance to translate, though many drell apply genetic modification to their eyes in order to perceive higher frequency flashes which allows them to understand the hanar. Most hanar take offense at improper language and must take special courses to unlearn this tendency if they expect to deal with other species.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hanar Names</h2>\n<p>The hanar have two names, a \"face name\" and a \"soul name.\" The face name is used as a general label for use by strangers and acquaintances. The soul name is kept for use among close friends and relations and tends to be poetic.</p>\n<p><strong>Face Names</strong>: <em>Anrynder, Delanynder, Ellanpo, Hymydwhyn, Lopyldis, Malvyll, Opold, Sedlyner, Tolystoyl, Wynold, Zymandis</em></p>\n<p><strong>Soul Names:</strong> <em>Burns Brightest when the Foam Blooms, Casts Shadow on the Sun Flower, Emancipates the Tide from those that Pull, Heeds only to the Inner Lights, Illuminates the Folly of the Dancers, Regards the Works of the Enkindlers in Despair, Transforms the Stone into Water</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hanar Traits</h2>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Available Classes.&nbsp;</strong>Adept, Engineer</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Ability Score Increase. </strong>+2 Wisdom, +1 Charisma</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Age. </strong>Hanar usually reach maturity around 40 years and typically live to be 180 years old.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Alignment. </strong>Most hanar are lawful due to the religious influence on their society.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div><strong>Size. </strong>Due to their long tentacles, hanar \"stand\" about as tall as humans.

The Protheans arose from a single planet and developed an immense galaxy-wide empire encompassing many other spacefaring species. Not much is known about them, but many of their artifacts, ruins and technology have apparently survived the ages.</em></p>\n<h2>Ancient Empire</h2>\n<p>After achieving spaceflight, the Protheans discovered the ruins of a previous spacefaring race, the inusannon, and from those ruins learned about mass effect physics and developed FTL technology. The Protheans would expand throughout the galaxy with the help of the mass relay network and make the Citadel their capital.</p>\n<p>Early in their development, the Protheans encountered a hostile machine intelligence which threatened to overwhelm them. To defeat the machines, the Protheans decided to unite all of the galaxy's sentient organic life under their empire. The other organic races were free to resist, but those that tried were crushed, and none ever managed to best the Protheans' might.</p>\n<h2>Reaper Invasion</h2>\n<p>The Protheans' belief that they could hold their own against machine intelligence was shattered with the arrival of the Reapers in approximately 48,000 BCE, who were far more advanced than the machines the Protheans had been battling. They were caught completely off-guard by the scale and rapidity of the assault. The Reapers entered the galaxy through the Citadel, instantly decapitating the Protheans' government and disrupting the mass relay network, isolating Prothean systems from one another. The Protheans' greatest strength, their unified empire, proved to be their downfall.</p>\n<h2>Stasis</h2>\n<p>In a desperate attempt to survive the Reaper invasion, the Protheans built massive, hidden stasis facilities that could hold hundreds of thousands of stasis pods. Some facilities were found by Reaper agents or betrayed by indoctrinated Protheans. Unfortunately, the facilities that remained hidden faced another challenge: a finite power source. The VI's left to control these facilities began systematically cutting power to non-essential staff to conserve energy. 50,000 years later, the number of active pods in each facility might be less than a dozen and without knowing the location of these hidden bunkers, its impossible to know how many protheans have survived.</p>\n<h2>All Eyes on You</h2>\n<p>As a prothean, you constantly attract the attention of other races. Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and appearance all mark you as more alien than most aliens. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by your ancient culture, to say nothing of everyday beings who are eager to hear stories of your origin.</p>\n<h2>Avatars</h2>\n<p>Protheans that ascended to places of prominence in their society were designated as avatars, or exemplars, of a particular virtue of their culture. Example virtues include benevolence, cleanliness, courage, dignity, frugality, honor, justice, mercy, order, perseverance, temperance, tranquility, truthfulness, vengeance. As one of the last remaining Protheans, it is likely you are an avatar or, waking up to find you race all but extinct, you may self-appoint your own virtue.</p>\n<h2>Prothean Names</h2>\n<p>Interestingly, protheans name themselves, usually after an icon or mentor.

If you touch an object or creature and concentrate on it for 1 minute, you learn a few basic facts about it. You gain a mental image from the object or creature's point of view, learning of any events that have occurred within 10 meters of the object or creature within the past 24 hours.
